# fetch-api-quiz

This sports quiz is a simple project which uses GET requests to retrieve the data from an api using the fetch method.

The questions are then randomised and printed to the DOM one by one as the user gets the correct answer.

The quiz runs on a lives based format, and the amount the user gets is based on the number of questions they choose in the settings feature at the beginning of the quiz.

Not a responsive design.
